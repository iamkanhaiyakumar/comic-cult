## 🤔 What Challenges I Ran Into

<table>
    <tr>
      <td>🖼️ Comic Art Generation</td>
      <td>I wanted to create something fun that also provided a lot of learning opportunities. I used OpenAI's APIs and even utilized LangChain for some instances, but I wanted to take my project to the next level. I wanted to work with images, which led me to use Stable Diffusion models (which I had no idea how to use). I tried running the model locally and using Google Colab, but these approaches made me more perplexed. Eventually, I needed a Stable Diffusion API and key, which DreamStudio and Stability AI provided.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>🔧 Workflow/Pipeline Creation</td>
      <td>Developing the workflow was probably the most challenging part. This pipeline is the backbone of the project. At one point, I was so confused that I wanted to abandon the project. However, I slowly worked on creating a streamlined flow for generating dialogues (with Gemini's help), obtaining images (using Stability API), and adding dialogues onto images (using Canvas). Ensuring that all these steps were reliable and smooth was crucial for providing a good user experience.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>💬 Using Promises</td>
      <td>I had only heard and learned about promises but never utilized them in any of my projects until now. They were a lifesaver, helping me make the workflow better and more workable. Now, I want to use promises everywhere. I really got to understand promises, async/await, .then, and .catch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>🚫 Failure of Express Functions and Integration of Nodemailer</td>
      <td>I used Express for my backend to serve the front end through various routes. I never thought that res.sendfile and res.download would be so problematic. They are meant to send files from the backend to the frontend but were causing errors. I was considering abandoning this approach, but then Nodemailer came to mind. If Express functions didn't work, I planned to send the PDF to the user's email using Nodemailer, which proved to be extremely useful. In just a few minutes, I had it working.</td>
